# This manifest demonstrates the use of security contexts at both
# the Pod and container levels in Kubernetes. It defines a Pod that
# mounts a PersistentVolumeClaim and runs two init containers and
# one main container. Each init container runs as a different user
# and group, creating files in the shared volume with distinct
# ownership.
#
# - The first init container runs as user 1500, group 3500, and
#   creates /sec-ctx-vol/user-1500:3500-info.txt.
# - The second init container runs as user 2500, group 4500, and
#   creates /sec-ctx-vol/user-2500:4500-info.txt.
# - The main container lists the contents of /sec-ctx-vol.
#
# This setup demonstrates how files created by different users/groups
# retain their ownership, and how the main container can observe
# these differences. The Pod does not set a pod-level securityContext,
# so each container's securityContext (if any) applies.
#
# To check the result, you can run the following command after
# the Pod has completed:
#
# kubectl logs pod/sec-ctx-runas-demo
#
# The manifest also defines the required PersistentVolumeClaim.
