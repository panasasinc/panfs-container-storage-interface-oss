# Creates a StatefulSet named sample-statefulset with 3 replicas (pods).
# Each pod runs a single container based on the ubuntu:latest image, executing
# 'sleep infinity'. Each container mounts two volumes: /data5 and /data15.
# These volumes are provisioned from PersistentVolumeClaim templates
# (csi-volume-sts-5gb and csi-volume-sts-15gb). Each PVC requests storage
# (5Gi and 15Gi) and uses ReadWriteOnce, so each pod gets its own unique
# volumes. All pods run concurrently, each with isolated /data5 and /data15
# directories backed by separate persistent volumes.
